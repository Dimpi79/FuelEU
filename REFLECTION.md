# Reflection

Working on the FuelEU Compliance Dashboard taught me how to structure a real-world project using clean separation between core logic and framework details (Hexagonal Architecture). Connecting the backend and frontend helped reinforce understanding of API contracts, state management, and modular UI updates.

Using ChatGPT (GPT-5) significantly reduced time spent debugging Prisma setup, CORS issues, and React rendering errors. The agent provided guided reasoning and code adjustments that would have taken longer to research manually. However, I learned that AI suggestions sometimes need verification, especially with database and TypeScript model alignment.

The project also helped me understand the FuelEU Maritime regulatory formulas, particularly GHG Intensity and Compliance Balance. Integrating banking and pooling logic required careful validation to prevent negative pool totals.

If I continued the project, I would:
- Add authentication & multi-company ship ownership support
- Deploy backend to a cloud container (Railway / Fly.io)
- Add charting dashboards for year-to-year compliance trends

Overall, the workflow combining human judgment with AI-assisted development was efficient and effective.
